Beep Beep Beep Whirr! And the mechanical bird soared up and away! Indeed, **Aerial Robotics** is the most intriguing field in the world of Robotics.

## Summary
This blog is a guide to assemble a multicopter with an onboard low level microcontroller, starting from the very quad-root level.
Hop onboard, let's get started.

## Configuration

### APM/Pixhawk - The low level controller

Ardupilot Mega (APM) is an IMU autopilot that is based on the Arduino Mega platform. It is capable for autonomous stabilisation, way-point based navigation and two way telemetry with Xbee wireless modules, supporting 8 RC channels with 4 serial ports.  ArduPilot Mega consists of the main processor board and the IMU shield which fits above or below it.
