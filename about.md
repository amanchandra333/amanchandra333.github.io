<p>I'm a Software Development Engineer at CodeNation Innovation Labs. I recently graduated from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in" target="_blank">IIT Kharagpur</a> with a major in Biotechnology. My interests range from robotics to autonomous systems to problem solving in general. I am an extreme member of the Harry Potter fandom. Metal music makes me supercharged and my best pastime is playing Table Tennis.
