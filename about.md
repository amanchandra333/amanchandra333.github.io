<p>Iâ€™m a second year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am majoring in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering. My research interests lie in Autonomous Robotics and Aerial Robotics. I am an extreme member of the Harry Potter fandom. Metal music makes me supercharged and my best pastime is playing Table Tennis.
